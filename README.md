A full-stack event operations company website built with Next.js.

## About VROOM

VROOM is a full-stack event operations company. We automate the logistical backbone of events — venues, vendors, coordination, execution — so that hosts can focus on taste, intention, and human judgment.

In-person gatherings shape culture, relationships, and trust. But today, hosting a good one requires either an exhaustive network of providers, or exhausting operational work. VROOM exists to remove this friction, allowing anyone to host an event.

## Services

- **VROOM Select**: White-label execution for relationship-critical events
- **VROOM Partnerships**: Long-term collaboration for cultural infrastructure

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router

- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 3**

## Design

- Clean, minimal aesthetic
- Brand colors: Cream (#E8E4DE), Burgundy (#8B2020), Navy (#1E3A5F), Forest Green (#2D4A3E)
